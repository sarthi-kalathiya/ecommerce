Database:
By default, Django uses SQLite for development. You can find the database file (db.sqlite3) in the project directory.

For production, you'll need to configure a different database (e.g., PostgreSQL, MySQL).

Running the development server:

```
python manage.py runserver
```


This will start the development server at http://127.0.0.1:8000/
